Headache guidelines:

- Overview:
  - Headache is pain located in any region of the head (forehead, temples, back of head, or around the eyes).
  - Most headaches are benign (tension-type or migraine), but some can indicate serious conditions.

- Common mild / self-care headache:
  - Bilateral, dull, pressure-like pain related to stress, muscle tension, or long screen time.
  - No fever, stiff neck, confusion, speech or vision problems, weakness, or recent head injury.
  - Home care: rest in a quiet dark room, hydration, avoid triggers (bright light, loud noise), simple over-the-counter pain relief if not contraindicated, and monitor.

- Red flag / emergency headache (“thunderclap” or serious signs):
  - Sudden, severe “worst headache of life” that peaks within seconds to a minute.
  - Headache with:
    - Stiff neck, high fever, or rash.
    - Confusion, difficulty speaking, difficulty walking, or seizures.
    - Weakness or numbness on one side of the body.
    - Vision loss or double vision.
    - Recent head injury, fall, or blow to the head.
  - Headache in pregnancy with visual changes, high blood pressure, or severe swelling.
  - Action: call emergency services or go to the nearest emergency department.

- Urgent but not 911-level (see a doctor within hours to 1 day):
  - New or different headache in someone over 50.
  - Headache that is gradually worsening over days and not responding to usual treatment.
  - Headache with persistent vomiting.
  - Headache triggered by exertion, coughing, or sexual activity.
  - Headache in someone with a history of cancer, blood clotting problems, or on blood thinners.

- Routine / non-urgent:
  - Recurrent similar headaches diagnosed previously as migraine or tension-type, with familiar pattern and no new red-flag features.
  - Action: discuss with primary care or specialist for prevention, trigger management, and medication adjustment if needed.

- General advice:
  - Anyone with red-flag features should not delay emergency evaluation.
  - This guidance is for information only and does not replace a professional medical assessment.
