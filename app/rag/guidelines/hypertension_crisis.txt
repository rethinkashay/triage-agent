A hypertensive crisis occurs when blood pressure spikes dangerously high (typically >180/120).
Symptoms may include severe headache, chest pain, blurry vision, confusion, nausea, or shortness of breath.  
This may indicate organ damage (heart, kidneys, brain) requiring urgent medical evaluation.

Mild BP elevation without symptoms may be monitored and managed with medication adjustments.
