Head injuries can be minor or life-threatening.

Emergency warning signs after a head injury include:
- Loss of consciousness at any time
- Repeated vomiting
- Seizures or convulsions
- Severe or worsening headache
- Weakness, numbness, or difficulty speaking
- Confusion, agitation, or unusual behavior
- Unequal pupil size or vision changes
- Clear fluid or blood leaking from nose or ears

These symptoms require urgent medical evaluation to rule out serious brain injury or bleeding.

Mild head injuries (no loss of consciousness, mild headache, no vomiting, acting normally) may be observed at home with:
- Rest
- Avoiding high-risk activities
- Monitoring for changes in behavior or new symptoms

Any deterioration after a head injury should prompt immediate medical assessment.
