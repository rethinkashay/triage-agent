Diabetic emergencies include very high blood sugar (hyperglycemia, possible ketoacidosis) and very low blood sugar (hypoglycemia).

Red flags for high blood sugar emergencies:
- Excessive thirst, frequent urination
- Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain
- Deep or rapid breathing, fruity breath odor
- Confusion, drowsiness, or unconsciousness

Red flags for low blood sugar emergencies:
- Shakiness, sweating, fast heartbeat
- Confusion, irritability, or behavior changes
- Difficulty speaking or coordinating movements
- Seizures or loss of consciousness

Any diabetic person with confusion, severe vomiting, breathing changes, or loss of consciousness needs emergency care.

Mild low blood sugar (when the person is awake and able to swallow safely) may improve with quick sugar sources and follow-up carbohydrate per local medical guidance.
Always follow the treatment plan provided by the person’s diabetes care team.
