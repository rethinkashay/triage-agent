Migraines are severe, throbbing headaches often accompanied by nausea, sensitivity to light or sound, and visual aura.  
Emergency evaluation is required for:
- “Worst headache of life”
- Sudden onset headache
- Headache with fever, neck stiffness, confusion, vision changes, or weakness

Typical migraines improve with rest in a dark room, hydration, and prescribed medications.
