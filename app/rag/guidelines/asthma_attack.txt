Asthma flare-ups cause shortness of breath, chest tightness, and wheezing.
Emergency signs include:
- Inability to speak full sentences  
- Bluish lips  
- Use of accessory muscles to breathe  
- No improvement after rescue inhaler  
- Peak flow <50% baseline

Mild asthma episodes often improve with inhaler use, hydration, and avoiding triggers.
