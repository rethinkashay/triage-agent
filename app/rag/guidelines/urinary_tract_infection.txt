UTIs commonly cause burning during urination, frequent urge to urinate, and lower abdominal discomfort.  
Red flags:
- Fever  
- Back/flank pain  
- Nausea and vomiting  
These may indicate kidney infection (pyelonephritis), requiring prompt treatment.

Uncomplicated UTIs in adults usually improve with prescribed antibiotics and hydration.
