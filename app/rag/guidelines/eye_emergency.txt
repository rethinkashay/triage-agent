Eye symptoms can threaten sight if not treated promptly.

Red-flag eye symptoms:
- Sudden loss of vision in one or both eyes
- Sudden severe eye pain or headache around the eye
- Seeing flashes of light, a curtain over vision, or a large number of new floaters
- Chemical splash in the eye
- Penetrating eye injury or foreign body stuck in the eye
- Marked redness with decreased vision and severe pain

These signs may indicate retinal detachment, acute glaucoma, serious infection, or trauma and need urgent eye specialist assessment.

Mild symptoms such as minor irritation, mild redness without vision change, or dry eyes can often be managed with lubricating drops and avoiding irritants, but persistent or worsening symptoms should still be evaluated.
