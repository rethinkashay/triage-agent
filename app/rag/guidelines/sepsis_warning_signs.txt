Sepsis is a life-threatening reaction to infection.

Warning signs may include:
- Fever or very low temperature with chills
- Rapid heart rate and rapid breathing
- Extreme weakness or inability to stand
- Confusion, disorientation, or feeling “out of it”
- Very low urine output or dark, concentrated urine
- Pale, clammy, or mottled skin

People at higher risk include older adults, very young children, and those with chronic illnesses or weak immune systems.

Suspected sepsis is always an emergency.
Urgent medical assessment is needed if a person with infection develops confusion, low blood pressure, or difficulty breathing.

Milder infections without these signs can often be managed with oral fluids, rest, and prescribed medications, but should be monitored closely.
