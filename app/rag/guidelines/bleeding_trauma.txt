Severe bleeding and trauma can be immediately life-threatening.

Red-flag signs:
- Heavy bleeding that does not stop with direct pressure
- Blood soaking through large bandages or spurting from a wound
- Signs of shock: pale, cold, clammy skin; rapid pulse; confusion; fainting
- Significant head, chest, or abdominal injury
- Obvious deformity of limb with severe pain
- Difficulty breathing after chest or neck injury

These situations require urgent emergency medical care.

While waiting for emergency help:
- Apply firm, direct pressure to bleeding wounds using clean cloth if available
- Keep the person lying down if possible
- Do not move the person unnecessarily if you suspect neck, back, or serious limb injuries

Minor cuts and bruises that stop bleeding and have no signs of infection or deep tissue damage can often be managed with cleaning and basic first aid.
